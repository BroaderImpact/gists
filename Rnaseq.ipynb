Machine learning-based methods are able to identify DEGs that are not seen by traditional RNA-seq methods. Further, models based on InfoGain feature selection and Logistic Regression classification are powerful tools for DEGs prediction. \n","\n","The pipeline below represents work I completed during the early days of these strides.
