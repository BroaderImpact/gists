    "Lipidomics is a complex analytical endeavor. The goal of identifying differential expression *in silico* often becomes a proverbial \"fishing expedition\". To inject precision into the label-free mass spectrometric analysis of lipids, the following pipeline was developed. \n",
    "\n",
    "First, .raw files from the liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LCMS) were converted into mzML files. A first pass of these files was performed with SIMLipid, a proprietary software that relies upon the [LipidMAPS](https://www.lipidmaps.org/) database. Files were then converted to .csv for data cleaning and batch analysis. The homogeneous distribution of matrix-cluster signals were identified for each of the matrices employed, followed by the identification of homogeneous distribution of endogenous molecular signals in positive and negative ion mode. The inclusion of both external (ESTD) and internal (ISTD) standards allows for confirmation of lipid abundance using normalization algorithms. Subsequently, principal component analysis (PCA) was performed."

    "Briefly, following attribution of signals to LipidMAPS identities, means and deviations thereof were calculated with relative abundance values. Covariant matrices were constructed, with several iterations of eigenvector calculations and values of covariance for each. Finally, data z-scores were projected onto new basis.
